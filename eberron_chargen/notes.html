The new "Eberron" campaign world is oriented toward "noir" and pulp fiction.
The heroes try to maintain their own integrity in a world filled with
dark secrets, where things
are seldom what they seem.
</p><p>
</p><p>Following the example in the "Player's Handbook", I chose to leave space for
players to write their own spells as they are learned, since this is likely to 
vary some among campaigns.  To limit size, the character sheet does not show
magewright spell counts.  I left gestalt and epic characters in, though they
may not exist in Eberron. 
 For restrictions on NPC/other classes
and new classes, see the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pathguy.com/cg35.htm#npcotherrestrictions"></a>basic generator.

</p><p>Random rolls that guarantee certain point-buy values are available. 
Low-power: 15-21. Easy 22-24. Standard 25-27. Tougher 28-31. High-power: 32+. 
</p><p>When the height is selected or randomly generated, the initial weight shown 
is around the <a href="http://www.pathguy.com/lectures/nutr.htm#idealwt" target="_blank">actual real-world weight</a> for a lean person of that height and 
strength. 
</p><p>I allowed anyone with the "martial weapon proficiency" or "exotic weapon 
proficiency" to gear up with any of the respective weapons, since I expect that 
many groups do this (i.e., a cleric of a military sect could use any martial 
weapon). Make whatever adjustments are necessary.  I let elves have racial proficiency
in both longsword and scimitar.
</p><p>Hand-edit to customize your sheet in keeping with other publications and/or 
your own group's ideas.
</p><p>I chose to implement "monstrous humanoid" levels only for creatures
like centaurs.  If you want to play a "Hobgoblin 1 / Druid 4", perhaps
you can choose for your first level NPC/Other: Warrior, and hand-edit
as seems right.

</p><p>I have included a host of races and subraces from other sources, since
reportedly  anything that has existed elsewhere in the D&amp;D universe will eventually
be found in Eberron.
</p><p>I did not allow any racial ability reduction to take any skill below 3. I 
assume that all characters can speak Common.
I am using the Expanded psionics handbook system for psionics.
I did not allow psions or artificers with intelligence&lt;11, psi-warriors with wisdom&lt;11,
or wilders with charisma&lt;11.
</p><p>If your character is of an unlisted race, or is an atypical specimen, make 
your own adjustments on the sheet as required.
</p><p>I hope visitors will consider adopting material from <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/880260000" target="_blank">The Book of Exalted Deeds</a>, especially feats that encourage 
subduing rather than really hurting opponents.
</p><p>Racial substitution levels seem likely to be generated for specific campaigns.
If a racial substitution option is available, and this makes a particular skill
a class skill (i.e., balance for an shifter ranger; survival for an elf paladin), this will appear as a checkmark
in the corresponding box.

</p><p>Epic characters are really too special for a limited generator like this one. 
I allowed one epic class. I am introduced gestalt offerings ("Unearthed Arcana") 
and am working out the problems. One gestalt combination only please.
</p><p>I did not include feats from the planar handbook, because Eberron's planes
are different.  I did not include feats from the Draconomicon because
Eberron's dragons are probably not yet so familiar with people.
</p><p>I did not require that all alchemist savants be (humans) from House Cannith.
</p><p>
This is a family-friendly website, and there will not be
room here for any material from the "Book of Vile Darkness"
or the new "Tome of Magic."  (<i>Tell truth and shame the devil.</i> --
Shakespeare, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shakespeare-literature.com/Henry_IV,_part_1/8.html">I Henry IV</a>.)</p><p>

</p><p>The following races are available on my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pathguy.com/cg35.htm">general
character generator</a>: Buomman, Chaos Gnome, Dream Dwarf, Feral Gurgan, Goliath, Gray Orc, Mephling, Mongrelfolk,
Neraph, Shadowswyft, Saurials, Spiker, Stonechild, Whisper Gnome, Wildren.  As new non-Eberron
races are developed, they will be added there without duplication here, in order to save
memory and running time.  Thank you for understanding.
</p><p>According to the official errata, the Talenta sharrish has a critical
threat range of 19-20, not 19-20/x4.</p><p>
Since the program ignores the rule about not returning to the monk or paladin
classes, monks who wish to do so may simply skip Eberron's "monastic training".
It is still a requirement to be a tashalatora.
</p><p>For adepts who wish to take the "Sovereign Speaker" prestige class, use the "Other" prestige class option.  Sorry.
</p><p>I have chosen to waive (at the request of my cyberfriend Roy Anderson)
the old prohibition on fighters taking levels as swashbucklers.
