<h3>Brief History of the 14th Volunteer Bombardment Squadron:</h3>
<p>Organized under Chennault's leadership in the autumn of 1937, the 14th Volunteer Bombardment Squadron  (which some sources refer to as the International Air Squadron) was the first predominantly American volunteer combat group in China. Chennault's pilot roster never numbered more than a dozen, even counting the odd French or Australian adventurer who occasionally would show up. The hard core of the 14th VBS pilot cadre consisted of James W.M. Allison, a veteran of fighter operations in the Spanish Civil War, Billy MacDonald, Luke Williamson, and George Weigle all of whom were handpicked by Chennault. Most of the rest who scrambled to join up in the 14th were not of the same high caliber. Its commander was an American WWI veteran, Vincent Schmidt, and its air gunners and ground staff were Chinese. The squadron's equipment was equally cosmopolitan: Vultee V-11 and Northrop 2E light bombers, a couple of Martin 139 medium bombers, an armed Bellanca 28-90 racing plane, and a pair of Dewoitine D-510 fighters.</p>

<p>The combat history of the 14th is described only in pilot diaries. The 14th Squadron's Northrop bombers carried out some of China's first offensive actions when they bombed Japanese lines on August 14, 1937.  One surviving account records that the 14th was in heavy action during the winter of 1937-1938. On Feb. 27, 1938, Vultee and Northrop bombers attacked Japanese troops and convoys in the vicinity of Loyang on the Yellow River. After bomb release, the formation's gunners administered a heavy strafing to troop concentrations near boats drawn up on the shore, apparently in preparation for a river crossing.</p>

<p>Although the combat history of the 14th was short, it was intense. In the five months the outfit was a formal entity, one pilot recorded that he flew 116 sorties, which included 28 bombing missions and 15 night missions. Most of these missions were to targets in northern China and involved round-trip flying times as high as nine hours. Bombers weren't very fast in those days.</p>

<p>The 10th Squadron under the command of Vincent Schmidt and manned with non-Soviet volunteers (including several Americans) received Vultee V-11s during January. The 14th VBS was stationed at Hankow in 1938 at the same time as a large Soviet contingent. The Soviet commitment in China consisted of twin-engine Tupolev SB-2 bombers and Polikarpov I-15 biplane and I-16 monoplane fighters. In January 1938 Japanese aircraft repeatedly conducted attacks on Nan Ning. On one occasion five V-11 light bombers rose to intercept Japanese bombers and shot down two aircraft, losing their own aircraft No. 507. Western pilots also served on Hawk IIIs at Hanchow (4th Wing) and on D-510s at Kunming.</p>

<p>The 14th VBS was disbanded March 22, 1938, and, though it was gone, some of its pilots soldiered on in China. A letter written by Chennault records that, on April 29, 1938, his pilots participated with Soviet airplanes and pilots in an action that enticed the Japanese to fall into a trap prepared long in advance. It must have been some fight since eight enemy bombers and 13 fighters went down, accompanied by the loss of nine CAF fighters. Pilots of two of those nine CAF aircraft bailed out safely and two others made successful forced landings. This &quot;fur ball&quot; included 60 fighters in the Chinese force against 12 bombers and 25 fighters in the Japanese force.</p>

<h3>Japanese Forces:</h3>
<div class="cHeadline4">Some conflicting facts in these accounts; presented as originally reported.</div>

<p>The light aircraft carrier Hosho with ancient A2N fighters was posted together with the carrier Ryujo to 1st Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet, leaving the port of Sasebo on 12 August. Arriving in the Ma-an-shan Islands area, they started supporting land operations beginning on 16 August. During this period, both Kaga and Ryujo groups had opportunity to engage in aerial battles.</p>

<p>Between 10 to 20 August the heavier aircraft carrier Kaga acted in support of the transportation of army units to China. Starting on 15 August it conducted aerial operations off Shanghai. As of 15 August, aircraft on board the Kaga consisted of 22 carrier attack aircraft (Mitsubishi B2Ms), 14 carrier bombers (Aichi D1A1s) and 16 A2N fighters.</p>

<p>The 12th Kokutai was formed from the Sacki Kokutai on 11 July. It was equipped with twelve Type 95 carrier fighters (Nakajima A4N1), twelve Type 94 carrier bombers (Aichi D1A1) and twelve Type 92 carrier attack aircraft (Yokosuka B3Y1). The Kokutai was immediately posted to the 2nd Rengo Kokutai (Combined Air Group). On 7 August the unit advanced to the Chowshihtze (Shusuishi) airport in Luda (Dairen) where it was engaged in convoy escort duties. There were no opportunities for aerial combat and the unit returned to Japan towards the end of August.</p>

<p>The 13th Kokutai was formed from the Omura Kokutai on 11 July. It was equipped with twelve Type 96 carrier fighters (Mitsubishi A5M), six Type 96 carrier bombers (Aichi D1A2) and twelve Type 96 carrier attack aircraft (Yokosuka B4Y1). On 7 August the unit advanced to the Chowshihtze (Shusuishi) airport but returned to its own base by the end of August.
In August the Kanoya Kokutai was integrated into the 1st Rengo Konutai and advanced to the base at Taipei.</p>

<p>The Kisarazu Kokutai lost one Hiro G2H1 (Type 95 land-based attack aircraft) (of a total of seven G2H1s) when they flew to Cheju-Do during August.</p>
