<p>Acting operational CO of the Chinese Air Force, Claire Chennault, organizes an attack against Japanese warships anchored off Shanghai.</p>

<p>Chinese Northrop Gamma 2E bombers took off from Guangde, about 120 miles west of Shanghai with early Curtiss Hawk II dive-bombers supporting them. About 40 planes arrived over Shanghai, which was covered in thick cloud. The Curtiss Hawks began dive-bombing the Japanese Marine headquarters at the Kung Ta textile mills while Northrops attacked Japanese
cruisers and supply ships at Wusong and the Japanese warship Idzumo, then lying moored to the Nippon Yusen Kaisha wharf close to the Japanese Consulate General, just east of the mouth of Soochow Creek, which served as the Japanese military headquarters. One of the 550-pound bombs fell at the crowded intersection of Nanking Road and the Bund while two more bombs from a Northrop fell on bustling Avenue Edward VII. The bombs caught crowds of onlookers gazing up at the planes and the loss of life was appalling - 1,740 people killed and 1,873 injured.</p>

<p>Player leads two bomb-carrying Hawk II fighters and four Northrop Gammas. The Hawks are instructed to attack the Japanese flagship, the pre-dreadnought Idzumo (AAA: 9 x 80mm, 3 x 7.7mm). </p>

<p>As the raid began, a single E4N2 Type 90 scout-observation seaplane of the Idzumo attacked the enemy formations, downing one Hawk II.</p>

<p>Low clouds limit approach altitude to 1500 feet. Time of attack: about 10 a.m. &quot;Friendly-fire&quot; targets include HMS Cumberland, USS Augusta and Shanghai city structures. Mission goal: Damage the Idzumo without causing collateral damage to Shanghai or friendly warships. </p>

The twelve Type 89 bombers, led by Group Commander Lieutenant Commander Iwai, left the Kaga for a raid against Hangchou. Bad weather prevented a rendezvous with an expected fighter escort and near their target the bombers were attacked by a group of Chinese fighter planes. Eleven bombers, including the commander's, were shot down. Lieutenant (JG) Tanaka managed to bring his bullet-riddled and crippled bomber safely back to the carrier; otherwise, the fate of the attacking group would never have been known, and another bomber formation might have suffered a similar fate. Tanaka's report astonished the officers of the fleet, and immediate warnings were issued to all bomber groups to take special precautions against the defending Chinese fighters.</p>

<p>A flat-bottomed craft built in Shanghai specifically for river duty, Panay served as part of the U.S. Navy's Yangtze Patrol in the Asiatic Fleet, which was responsible for patrolling the Yangtze River to protect American lives and property.</p>

<p>With Japanese forces moving on Nanking in December, Captain James Hughes assisted the evacuation of American citizens and three Standard Oil tankers from the city on December 11. The number of people aboard Panay rose to five officers, fifty-four enlisted men, four U.S. embassy staff, and ten civilians.</p>

<p>The following day, while upstream from Nanking, the Panay and three tankers, Mei Ping, Mei An, and Mei Hsia, came under attack from Japanese naval aircraft. The Japanese planes (Aichi D1A2s and possibly G3Ms) attacked at 1:27 p.m. The Panay was bombed and sunk; three men were killed, and forty-three sailors and five civilians were wounded. The Japanese
also destroyed the three tankers. Survivors were later taken on board U.S.S. Oahu, and H.M.S. Ladybird and Bee.</p>

<p>The Japanese claimed that they did not see the US flags painted on the deck of the gunboat, apologized and paid an indemnity. Nevertheless, the attack and reports of the &quot;Rape of Nanking&quot; caused U.S. opinion to turn sharply against the Japanese.</p>

<p>January 4, 1938</p>

<p>Sixteen A5Ms escorting bombers fought with a group of 18-20 I-15bis and I-16 fighters in a battle above Hankou. Participating in this battle were seven Hawk IIIs and one Fiat CR.32 along with the Soviet pilots.</p>

<p>Shortly after its first mission the 10th BS was attacked one morning at Hankou by Japanese aircraft. The V-11s were gassed and armed for another raid when a Japanese bomb exploded and the entire row blew up. The squadron was sent to Chengdu and disbanded on 23 February (according to other sources during March) due to inactivity</p>

<p>January 26, 1938 </p>

<p>Before dawn 13 SBs took off to attack the captured Nanking airfield. The uncamouflaged Japanese aircraft including G3M2s, A5Ms, and Ki-10s stood in a line along the airfield boundary. In the air there was a defensive patrol of A4N carrier fighters. </p>

<p>January 27, 1938</p>

<p>The Japanese retaliated to the raid on Nanking when nine G3M2s bombed Hankou, dropping bombs from 2000 meters. Chinese fighters intercepted the bombers but didn't manage to inflict any losses. One bomber was shot down by antiaircraft fire and it fell not far from the airfield. Thanks to the Chinese warning system the airfield had been empty during the raid.</p>

At 10:50 they spotted nine dive-bombers at 13,000ft and 15 &quot;pursuits&quot; (actually five fighters and nine dive-bombers) at 17,000ft above Jiangchuan (a hamlet located north-west of Tienhe airbase). It was clear that they were heading for the Tienhe airbase.</p>

<p>April 29, 1938 (Emperor Hirohito's birthday)</p>

<p><b>Hirohito's Surprise: </b>18 G3M2s of the Japanese Naval Air Force escorted by 27 A5Ms attacked Wuhan. Reconnaissance revealed the Japanese intentions in good time, and a trap was set. The first communications from the air warning system (VNOS) began to be received at 10:00. That day dense clouds at several levels covered the sky, beginning at 2000-2500 m. At 14:00, when the Japanese aircraft approached Wuhan, a combined force of Soviet and Chinese fighters were already waiting in the air with sufficient altitude. According the previously drawn up plans, the I-15s closed in on the Japanese fighters in a pincer attack while the I-16 formation fell upon the bombers.</p>

<p>May 31, 1938</p>

<p>The Japanese execute a new attack on the aerodromes of fighters defending the Chinese capital. The Chinese had received advance information and were ready for them, having been able to concentrate aircraft at the Hankou aerodrome already the day before.</p>

<p>At 10:15 18 G3M2 bombers were spotted over Tung Chin by Chinese air defense lookouts followed by a reported 36 enemy aircraft over Lu-Jiang at 10:45. 46 enemy aircraft were spotted over the Camel Pass at 11:45 followed by a report of 39 enemy fighters near Qing-Shan at 12:00.</p>

<p>Thus, at midday a reported 39 enemy fighters and 18 enemy bombers approached Wuhan. At 11:50 49 Chinese interceptors successively began taking off from Wuhan. The Chinese fighters were four I-15bis from the 3rd PG, eight I-15bis and six I-16s (of the 21st PS) from the 4th PG, 21 I-15bis and ten I-16s from the Soviet volunteers. The 31 Soviet volunteers become the main attack force according to a previously devised plan while the 18 Chinese fighters climbed higher to provide an echeloned covering detachment. The fighters patrolled between Hankou and Qing-Shan.</p>

<p>Even before the appearance of the bombers, one of the groups of fighters flown by the Soviet volunteers was attacked at 12:07 by 18 A5Ms at 4500 meters. The Japanese fighter formation was reported to be 39 aircraft flying in a 'V' formation with 18 fighters at 4500 meters, 12 at 5000 meters and the high-cover of 9 fighters at 6000 meters.</p>

<p>At 13:00 on May 31, 1938 nine E8N aircraft were spotted by ground observers. The IJNAF floatplanes were flying toward Hukou from Shu Sung in the Anhuei Province. Five Gladiators flew to intercept. They sighted nine E8Ns in a 'V'  formation at 6000 feet near Hukou. The Gladiators had a height advantage of 1500 feet.</p>

<p>On June 16, 1938 reports indicated that nine enemy fighters were sighted near Nan Hsiung. Nine Gladiators were dispatched from Xiaoquan airbase to intercept. As they reached 13000 feet above Xixin, they saw six G3M2 heavy bombers in two 'V' formations flying 2000 feet below.</p>

<p>On June 28, 1938 six SBs flew from Nanchang to bomb the Japanese ships in the neighborhood of the Madanyaosai fortress. On the flight there they became separated from the escorting I-16s and were intercepted by Nakajima A4Ns.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1938 the Chinese sent up 65 fighters over Nanchang against 23 A5Ms and 26 G3M2s. </p>

<p>On July 7, 1938, the first anniversary of the start of the Sino-Japanese war there was a huge air battle over Nanchang. I-15s and I-16s intercept Japanese force of Nells and Claudes.</p>

<p>On July 16, 1938 fifteen A5Ms escorted groups of 18 land-based bombers attacking Nanchang and the aerodrome at Xiaogan. Chinese Gladiators flew to intercept.</p>

<p>On July 18, 1938 fourteen Aichi D1A2 carrier bombers and five Yokosuka B4Y carrier attack aircraft, escorted by six A5Ms participated in the attacks on Nanchang.</p>

<p>At 07:40 on August 3, 1938, 18 G3Ms were seen flying over Guangde. Later at 09:00, more than 70 Japanese A5M and A4M fighters were reported heading for Hankou. In response to this treat, the Chinese Air Force scrambled 52 fighters consisting of 20 I-15bis, 13 I-16s, 11 Gladiators and 7 Hawk IIIs in four groups from Hankou to intercept the Japanese intruders.</p>

<p>At 09:50 on August 30, 1938, Nan Hsiung Command Post received a transmission that nine D1A2s had started from an airbase in Fujien to bomb Huizhou in the Guangdong Province. When it was confirmed that the D1As were crossing the Fujien/Jiangxi provincial border, Gladiators scrambled to intercept the enemy bombers. The Japanese force seems to have consisted of six A5Ms led by Lieutenant Teshima, five carrier based bombers and 4 carrier based attack planes from Kaga.</p>

<p>On 6 October three Ki-10s intercepted eight SBs over Xinyang and claimed two of them shot down.</p>

<p>At 13:50 on February 20, 1939 the Air Defence Command at Sian spotted 30 Japanese aircraft (Mitsubishi Ki-21s and Fiat BR.20s) heading towards Lanzhou in the Kansu province in Northwest China.</p>

<p>Nine I-15s scrambled first to intercept the Japanese aircraft and was later joined by two more. Later Russian volunteers were scrambled at 14:05 with seven I-15bis and one I-16. At 14:10 four I-15s, one I-16 and one Curtiss Hawk took off from the Siku field.</p>

<p>On April 29, 1939 (Japanese Emperor Hirohito's birthday), seven Ki-27 Nates conducted a fighter sweep from Tuncheng against the Chinese Airfield at Nancheng. The Chinese scrambled six I-15bis to intercept.</p>

<p>On October 3, 1939 the Kulishenko's group attacked Hankou aerodrome, which by then was in the deep rear of the enemy. The SBs could not reach this far and the Japanese did not expect any attacks. In the open the Japanese had located a naval aviation aerodrome designated &quot;Base W&quot;. It was also used by pilots of Army Aviation. On this day the airbase prepared to receive new aircraft ferried from Japan and representatives of the fleet command and the city authorities had assembled there. </p>

<p>Nine DB-3s flew to the target unobserved, in a tight wedge, maintaining radio silence. They attacked as the ceremony was in progress. Aircraft stood in four rows, wing tip to wing tip. The bombers attacked from an altitude of 8700 m.</p>

<p>The attack on Hankou aerodrome was repeated on October 14, 1939. Twelve DB-3s flew to the target, again led by Kulishenko. But just after dropping their bombs they were attacked by Japanese fighters and three bombers received damage.</p>

<p>On November 4, 1939 72 G3Ms attacked Chengdu in Sichuan Province in retaliation for a highly successful attack on the Hankou Huang-chia-tun Airfield on October 14, 1939. The G3Ms came over in two formations, each with 36 aircraft.</p>

<p>The Chinese responded by sending two formations against the attackers. The first Japanese formation was heavily attacked by seven Dewoitine D.510s and seven I-15s. Contact made at 4,000m.</p>

<p>On December 27, 1939 two Gladiators and one I-15s escorted three Soviet Volunteer SB bombers. During the mission they became involved in combat with Japanese A5M Claudes.</p>
