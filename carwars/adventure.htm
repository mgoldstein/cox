<p><b>Adventure:</b></p>

<p>Characters start in Needles, CA. A man finds them in a bar
late at night. He shows them a digital video he shot of his trip to the Oildale
refinery. The refinery sits atop a tall bluff, invisible from roadside, a
skeleton crew has been operating it recently, producing gasoline.</p>

<p><b>Encounter #1</b>: On the road to Bakersfield in the
middle of the Mohave the PC's happen upon the conclusion of a long car chase. A
car has apparently been driven off of the road. Two bikers and a mid-sized car
(Greased Lightning) sit on the shoulder overlooking a steep gully. The victim's
car lies upside-down in the ditch. If the PC's approach too close, the bikers
will charge and attempt to impale them with their Spears. If the bikes are
destroyed, Greased Lightning will speed away. </p>

<p><b>Aftermath</b>: There are two bodies in the wrecked car,
one is quite dead, the other barely alive. If the players assist the dying
motorist, he will whisper the password to gain entry into the refinery and ask
them to give Sara his locket. He will then die unless the PC's can revive him
with a paramedic skill roll. If they resuscitate him, he will still have -3 DP
and will be unable to function; he will sleep most of the time and cannot
engage in any form of combat. His compact car is a total loss, but has five
gallons of gas in the tank and a CB radio. He carries a Scattergun (To Hit: 6.
1 GE. 1d-4x3 out to 2&quot;, 1d-4x2 from 2&quot;- 4&quot;, 1d-4 from 4&quot;-6&quot; Range Mod: 2&quot; Max
Range: 6&quot; Ammo: 2) with six extra shells.</p>

<p>2) <b>The Armory</b>: From the ditch they notice the
entrance to the Armory. Inside the Armory they run into two of the gang
members. </p>

</table>

<p>The gang members retreat into the adjacent office during the
ensuing gun battle; moments later the players will hear a piercing scream and
the first biker will run from the room into the players' line of fire.</p>

<p>In the office the players will find a Giant Tarantula
clinging to the wall with the body of the biker hooked on its fangs. It will
not attack unless attacked by the players, but it will attempt to hide in its
nest first. </p>

<p><b>Giant Tarantula</b>: 7 DP. Exoskeleton counts as leather
armor. Moves 2 squares/phase. Attacks in HTH with its fangs: To Hit 6, 1d-2.
The outlaw has dropped his derringer and nunchakus. </p>

<p>In the corner an open hatch reveals a ladder leading down.
On this level the players run into a couple more outlaw bikers who are
preoccupied fighting off a gang of six dregs. Use the stats for the bikers
above, but they are armed with Crossbows, Large Knives, a Light Pistol (with
one extra clip), and a Flare Pistol. The dregs are all armed with a variety of
improvised melee weapons (shovels, baseball bats, axes, tire irons, rocks.)</p>

<p>In the armory room the players find armored storage doors
with numbers on them; a ledger on the desk has a list of the inventory of each
of the lockers: 75mm shells, Bazookas, LAWs, assault rifles, grenades, mortars,
machine-guns, flame-throwers. The doors are sealed electronically and
impossible to pry open. A switch on the other side of the complex will activate
the emergency power supply. With the power on the storage cells can be opened
with the right magnetic card key, now if only the PC's had a card key. . .</p>

<p>3) <b>Chase through Barstow</b>. In Barstow the PC's can go
to the local mechanic, junk dealer, or the gun shop. If they go to the bar they
will recognize Greased Lightning from the first encounter. In the bar the
outlaws who escaped in Greased Lightning examine a map of the Oildale refinery
and make plans to attack. The bar has a strict no-weapons policy (not counting
the bouncer's shotgun). The characters may smuggle weapons into the bar if they
weigh &frac12; GE. The PC's may choose to attack the outlaws. Soon after the fight
ends, a posse of outlaws and the Brinks Armored Car drive up outside the bar,
and the PC's must retreat.</p>

<p>4) <b>Race to the refinery</b>: The Armored car, a Compact,
a Mid-sized, and four Medium bikes pursue the PC's. A concrete bunker divides
the rose between the PC's and the outlaw vehicles. Up ahead, the road merges.
To get to the off-ramp that leads to the refinery the PC's must cross over to
the outlaw's side of the road. The refinery will interrogate the approaching
vehicles over the CB radio. They will open the gates only if the PC's identify
themselves and give the right password.</p>

<p><b>Aftermath</b>: PC's are trapped in the refinery with the
defenders. They can see the outlaws setting up a formidable roadblock. Through
binoculars they can also see the Outlaws towing a 75mm howitzer into position.
Over a sound system PA, the leader (Lord Tremendous) threatens to begin shelling
the refinery if the defenders do not abandon it.</p>

<p>The only way out is a small backroad down along the
mountainside. The outlaws haven't blockaded it yet, but they are slowly
surrounding the refinery and will soon discover the backroad.</p>

<p><b>Rival Factions</b>: The leader of the refinery defenders
is named Gunny Crawford, a ex-marine. Gunny wants to try and take as much
gasoline as possible and evacuate the refinery, destroying it so the outlaws
can't have it. The rival leader, Braggart wants to defend the refinery to the
last man, woman, and child. (There are about twenty adult men and women in the
refinery; the outlaws number at least 60 or more.) The players notice that
Gunny is wearing a card key around his neck!!!!! </p>

<p>If the players want to try and make a run for the armory,
Gunny will give them the card key and order Braggart to accompany them. Gunny
will give the players all the gas and Molotovs they can carry. They can't spare
any other weapons, although Braggart and his crew have their own firearms.</p>

<p>5) <b>The Mountain Road</b>: Braggart and the PC's are
pursued down the road by four Med. bikes and a Subcompact. At the bottom of the
road the PC's must race past about twenty pedestrians (most armed with
crossbows), four Med. bikes, a Compact, a Mid-Sized, and the Armored Car. </p>


<p>As they speed past, they notice that the back of the Station
Wagon is empty, the howitzer has no ammo.</p>

<p>6) <b>The Armory II</b>: Once they arrive, Braggart and his
three men pull out their weapons and ambush the players. If the PC's fight back,
Braggart will kill a couple characters until they surrender. Braggart will
shoot out the tires on the player's cars. One of Braggart's men will guard the
cars and about half the PC's outside; the rest will follow the players into the
armory. The players can trick Braggart into walking into the tarantula's nest,
which will give them a chance to counterattack. </p>

<p>7) OFF ROAD &amp; JUMP</p>

<p>Two Hvy. Cycles, and a Sedan appear behind the PC's as they
approach the refinery and make chase. Over the next rise the PCs' see that the
outlaws have finished erecting their roadblock. It is made of chains, steel
barrels loaded with water, and two wrecked cars, with ten pedestrians as a
garrison. A fire road leads off-road behind the cover of a group of trees to an
old collapsed bridge that the PC's can use to jump over a small stream running
through a deep gully. On the far side of the gully lies the 75mm howitzer. Only
a small garrison protects it.</p>
